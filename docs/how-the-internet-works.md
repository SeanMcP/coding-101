# How the internet works

The internet has become a crucial part of our lives in the 21st century. We use it to do important things like pay bills and register to vote, and less important things like watch videos and play games. I'm sure you use the internet everyday -- even multiple times a day.

But have you ever stopped and wondered: What is the internet? How does it work? If you're going to learn to be a web developer, you're going to need a basic understanding of the internet and how it functions.

## What is the internet?

Simply put, the internet is a network of networks. A network is a connection between two (or more) computers. Once computers are joined by a network, they can pass information or data to one another. The internet links all connected computers to one another so that they can share information.

### Data

All information on the internet needs to be stored on a computer somewhere. Most of that data are stored on special computers called servers. Servers exist to store information and "serve" it up when asked. These servers are often stored in large warehouses around the world.

### Addresses

When you navigate to a specific website, you are making a request for data. Think of every website's URL as a mailing address. Be entering it in your browser, you are sending a little mailworker to that address to ask for information. If you have the correct address, the homeowner can send you the information for the website.

On a moderate internet connection, the process of requesting data and receiving a response takes a few fractions of a second. But in that time, data can be travelling from your location around the world in back. That's the magic of the internet!

### Example

Let's illustrate this with an example. Imagine going to [YouTube](https://youtube.com). What do you see when you get there? There is a logo in the top left, some links going down the side, thumbnails, video titles, and view counts. When you hover over a thumbnail, the image jumps to life and gives you a preview of the video. If you click on a video, you're redirected to another page where the video plays (usually after an ad). You can read the comments below and check related videos.

By navigating to `https://youtube.com`, you made a request to a particular address. The server saw your request and sent you all of the data on the site (text, images, video, *etc.*). By clicking through the site, you sent additional requests to the server which sent you additional data. You've interacted with the internet!

## What it means for web developers

When web developers create applications, they need both an address and a server for their data. Until then, you can develop apps on your own computer and show them to your friends and family! Almost every web application was developed first on a local computer, so you're in good company.
