# Middle School

This curriculum is designed for an afterschool program at a middle school. Right now, I'm imagining 12-15 one-hour weekly lessons.

## Schedule

1. Introduction to the computer
2. How the internet works
3. Building webpages with HTML
4. More HTML
5. Styling webpages with CSS
6. More CSS

## Lesson Overviews

### Introduction to the computer

I'm operating under the assumption that students have very little familiarity working with a computer. This lesson focuses on teaching them at a high-level how a computer stores files (via a specific address), creating files and directories, editing files, and typing some of the odd characters needed for coding.

Special characters to practice:

- Gators: `<` and `>`; this language accords with the common practice of teaching comparisons as "alligators eating the larger number of fish"
- Braces: `{` and `}`
- Brackets: `[` and `]`
- Slash: `/` and `\`

### How the internet works

Building on the previous lesson, this will focus on how the internet connects computers together. Students will play a "go fish"-like game where they search for a resource with a given address.

Technology permitting, we can serve files created by the students and share the address so that their pairs can view them.
